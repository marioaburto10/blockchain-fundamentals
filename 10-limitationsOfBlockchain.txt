Limitations of Blockchain Technology

- Not the right choice for many situations

- It is still in an early stage, not many companies using it.

- Lots of lack of awareness and misconceptions about it

- Limited available technical talent 

- It is immutable. Cannot make any changes of a record. It is tamperproof but does not allow for reversals or modifications

- Key Management. Private keys can be easily lost and may lose assets.

- Scalability. Cannot handle large volumes just yet

- Time to process. In Bitcoin, it takes about 10 mins for all the nodes to reach a consensus to get the transactions out. Not good for banks or microsecond transactions
